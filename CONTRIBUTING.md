# Contributing

If you would like to contribute code to this project you can do so through GitHub by forking the repository and sending a pull request.

Before Comcast merges your code into the project you must sign the Comcast Contributor License Agreement (CLA).
If you haven't previously signed a Comcast CLA, you'll automatically be asked to when you open a pull request.
Alternatively, we can e-mail you a PDF that you can sign and scan back to us.
Please send us an e-mail or create a new GitHub issue to request a PDF version of the CLA.

## Reporting Feature Requests, Bugs, Vulnerabilities and other Issues

If you find a bug in Prombox, please file a detailed report as an Issue. We currently do not utilize an Issue template, but please be as thorough as possible in your report. There is no such thing as too much information.

Likewise, if you have a Feature Request, please file a detailed Issue, explaining the feature's functionality and use cases. Features should be useful to the broader community, so be sure to consider that before filing.

## Steps to Contribute

Should you wish to work on an issue, please claim it first by commenting on the GitHub issue that you want to work on it. This is to prevent duplicated efforts from contributors on the same issue.

If you have questions about one of the issues, please comment on them and one of the maintainers will clarify it.
